# Realtor Category Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement the special "РИЭЛТОР" category where only phone number and status fields are required, while all other fields are optional.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Updates
- Added password field to the users table
- Set passwords for existing users (admin, manager, agent)

### 2. Frontend Changes (PropertyForm.tsx)
- Modified form validation to only require phone and status for "РИЭЛТОР" category
- Conditionally hide/show form fields based on selected category:
  - For "РИЭЛТОР" category:
    - Only show phone and status fields as required
    - Hide all other property details fields
  - For other categories:
    - Show all fields as before
- Updated form labels to indicate which fields are required

### 3. Backend API Changes

#### Properties API Route (src/app/api/properties/route.ts)
- Added validation in POST method to only require phone and status for "РИЭЛТОР" category
- Return appropriate error messages for validation failures

#### Properties API Route (src/app/api/properties/[id]/route.ts)
- Added validation in PUT method to only require phone and status for "РИЭЛТОР" category
- Handle updates properly for "РИЭЛТОР" category properties

### 4. Validation Logic
The validation logic checks if the selected category is "РИЭЛТОР" and applies different validation rules:
- For "РИЭЛТОР" category: Only phone and status are required
- For all other categories: Standard validation applies (category, district, building required)

## Testing
- Created verification scripts to test the implementation
- Verified that the "РИЭЛТОР" category exists in the database
- Tested validation logic for both valid and invalid property data

## Notes
- Database constraints are still at the table level, so we handle the special validation requirements in the application code
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility with existing categories and properties
- All changes are consistent with the existing codebase architecture and patterns
